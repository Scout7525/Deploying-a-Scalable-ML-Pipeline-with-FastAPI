# Model Card

## Model Details

Model Type: Random Forest The model was trained using supervised learning techniques, leveraging Random Forest. It implements a machine learning pipeline ,evaluates performance using precision, recall, and F1 score, and providing functions for model inference and serialization.

## Intended Use

Primary users are soley connecected for UDACITY project.

## Training Data

Dataset used: Census.csv which is an extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database.The set included 14 features and 48,842 instances. Data types included numeric, string, and boolean types.

## Evaluation Data

Precision: How many of the modelâ€™s positive predictions are actually correct. Recall: How well the model finds all the actual positive cases. F1 Score: A balance between precision and recall, giving an overall performance score.

## Metrics

Precision: 0.7256 (72.56% of predicted positives are actual positives) 
Recall: 0.6233 (62.33% of actual positives are correctly identified)
F1: 0.6706 (Harmonic mean of precision and recall, indicating balanced performance). 

## Ethical Considerations

Privacy and Security: Compliance with data protection regulations

## Caveats and Recommendations

A reccomendation to improve the model is to prioritize improving precision to ensure the model's predictions are correct more often. Another reccomendation is to expand on datasets used so the model can train better.
